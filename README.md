# Naive RSA Encryption & Decryption Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains a naive implementation of RSA encryption and decryption. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the most widely used public-key cryptosystems for secure data transmission. This implementation is intended for educational purposes and may not be suitable for production use.
